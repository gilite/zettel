# Hello!

This is my first note :)

I've created a Zettelkasten vault before but it didn't really work out for me. It was too messy, and it didn't have any rules regarding note-storing, so here are my rules to set it straight.

I definitely feel like getting this down takes the mental burden off my brain on whether to keep things in my head ("taking up cognitive bandwidth", maybe?) and provide a quick decision-making process when mulling over problems that are not so clear-cut.

Of course this seems all too official - why am I even writing this? Lol. It's going to be an iterative process too, but this helps to solidify this workflow in my brain. I'm hoping that this would make it easier for me to get off the ground.

## Zettelkasten Litmus Test
> Is the idea original?
- If yes: Put it down! (Template: note.md)
- If no:
  > Is it easily Google-able (i.e. a simple concept that can be understood within 2 min of searching a Google query)? 
  - If *yes*: Maybe it isn't worth recording this note, but put in [[search-key]] and attach a phrase or sentence that defines or explains it (in my own words).
    - E.g. 64-bit computer - a computer that uses a processor register of size 64-bits
  - If *no*: Write a summary on it (Template: comment.md)
    - E.g. [What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth#oauth-flows)
    - E.g. Any idea that's non-original (e.g. tweets, blogs, videos, books)

## Other Life Hacking Parts

### Scheduling in tasks or events for the day
For Google Calendar:
- Tasks/events that involve other people
  - E.g. Zoom call with school groupmates

For Todoist:
- Personal and specific tasks
  - E.g. Solve LC Problem 1032, understand 'union find'

### Day Planning
Daily planning for the next day at 8pm every day.

### Distraction Squashing
Any fleeting and distracting thoughts that do not contribute to the progress of the ongoing goal shall go into Todoist > #Personal project. (I can come back to it at the end of the day :))

### Time Blocking
**Lengthening of time blocks**
Time blocks can be lengthened to my discretion, *but* time blocks should usually be scheduled with 30% of the original planned time to spare. (So try as much as you can to not lengthen the scheduled time block.)

**Start of time block - goal setting**
Set a goal for what you want to achieve within that time block.

- It should be something you can finish within 2/3 of the given time.
- Break it down into digestible parts.
- Don't be too ambitious.

### Break Times
Taking breaks are great. When a break is scheduled, try not to reschedule it unless completely necessary.

(I originally wrote "taking breaks are productive", but in hindsight - on top of being pedantic - I feel that it encourages the notion of being productive all the time, which may easily lead to burnout, or the association with intense activities with relaxed ones. It's better to believe that one should have *both* productive and non-productive times, and that's okay.)

Break times do include dabbling in hobbies, or doing absolutely nothing :D

Hobbies:
- Read books
- Playing the guitar

### Exercise
What can I say, I've been having a love-hate relationship with this for the longest time.

For the sake of my well-being, it's better to just adopt a healthy relationship to this. If I can't escape it, I might as well embrace it.

Furthermore, better blood flow and having a less-sedentary life style does wonders for the body and brain!

### Replying to messages
- Calls can be taken immediately.
- *All* messages should be left **unread** until the time block is over, or until the current time block's goal is achieved.
