- **Full binary tree**: a binary tree in which each parent either has 2 or no children.
- **Perfect binary tree**: a binary tree where every internal node has exactly 2 child nodes + all leaf nodes are at the same level.
- **Complete binary tree**: a binary tree where all levels except the last are full + leaf nodes on the last level are all leaning towards the left + if the last leaf node does not have a right sibling, it should be a left leaf node (i.e. it does not have to be a full binary tree).

- **Heap** *(data structure)*: a specialized binary tree-based data structure.
  - Usually represented as a max-heap (where the parent node is always greater than or equal to the child node) or min-heap (where the parent node is always lesser than or equal to the child node).
  - Also known as a *priority queue*.
  - It must also be a *complete* binary tree, where each level must be filled before moving on to the next. If a level is not full, the leaves must be positioned as far left as possible.
